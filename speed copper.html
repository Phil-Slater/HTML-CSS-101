    <h1>Kailh Speed Copper</h1>
    <p>Kailh Speed Copper switches have a small tactile bump at the very top of the keypress. After the bump, the
        switch has a smooth travel until bottoming out. The "Speed" name comes from the actuation point of the switch.
        It is at 1.1mm which makes it a good
        option for gaming keyboards where a fraction of a second can make a difference. </p>
