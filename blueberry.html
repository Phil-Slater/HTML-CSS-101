    <h1>Novelkeys x Kailh Blueberry</h1>
    <p>Blueberry switches have a large tactile bump at the top of the keypress. This bump is very pronounced and is a
        bit
        too large for my taste. The switch actuates after being pressed for 3mm which is much lower than standard
        switches (2mm).</p>

    <p>Here is a typing test with the Blueberry switch:</p>
